Easily add and approve guest posts to your Wordpress blog with the official Wordpress Guest Post plugin. 

== Description ==

The Guest Post plugin is a simple plugin that allows you to accept, edit, & publish guest posts to your blog without writers having to login to your Wordpress Admin area.
This plugin is originaly written by Lisa Angelettie. Due to lack of updates I copy the plugin and made some changes in order to make it work.

1. Easily obtain guest posts without user registration.
2. Users can add their posts right from a form hosted on a page on your blog. No logging in your Wordpress admin.
3. Effortlessly manage and edit post submissions
4. Customizable post submission notification on site and via email
